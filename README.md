EVER dashboard for the ZonMW project "Economische Veerkracht van Regio's"

Ambition of the project is to map regions by their economic resilience and investigate the entrepreneurial ecosystems that lie underneath these outcomes of resilience. We operationalise resilience as a form of both bounceback (the degree to which a region recovers to its original state before a crisis) and adaptability (the degree to which a region changes due to a crisis).

Primary ambition of the tool is to operationalise bounceback and adaptability for several economic output indicators including:
1) labour demand (vacancies)
2) labour availability (unemployment and/or jobs by industry)
3) new firm formation and firm termination
4) testt
